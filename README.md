# Features
* **REST Api for JaCoCo Coverage** — Manage Coverage data for a Set of configured application
* **Prometheus metrics for JaCoCo Coverage** — Monitor Jacoco Coverage for each application

## REST Api
* `POST /v1/reset` resets all coverage agents connected to the exporter
* `POST /v1/reset` with body `{"applications": ["app"]}` will only reset the specified list of applications
* `GET /v1/coverage` currently returns a simple overview page showing general coverage data for all applications, easy to consume data is currently only provided through the metrics endpoint.

## Prometheus Metrics

* `GET /actuator/prometheus` will also return prometheus metrics each top level coverage-type: `branches, instructions, methods, classes, lines, complexity`
  * `jacoco_<coverage-type>_covered{application="app"}`
  * `jacoco_<coverage-type>_missed{application="app"}`
  * `jacoco_<coverage-type>_total{application="app"}`
  * `jacoco_scrape_duration_seconds` duration for **any** coverage provider scrape, this currently is not labeled with the application being scraped
(there is no pre-made Grafana Dashboard for this yet)

## Liveliness and readiness probes
Liveliness and readiness endpoint is at `/actuator/health`.

# Getting Started

You can either build a jar yourself or use the container build through jib. 

## Helm Chart

The Helm Chart will be provided in the future through GitHub Pages and https://artifacthub.io/

## Providing Class Files

To be able to generate the coverage report the exporter requires access to the class files of each application.
If you are deploying this exporter in Kubernetes you can consider copying the class from the application image inside of init containers.

Because this process can might require a large amount of init containers please let me know how you would like to load your class files. 
I am planning to add different kinds of class file providers in the future.

## Configurations

Before you can fetch the coverage through this exporter you will need to add the jacoco agent to your testee. 
This can be achieved by adding the `jacocoagent.jar` (https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.jacoco/org.jacoco.agent) to the Pod of each application and adding the following `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`

```Java
-javaagent:/path/to/jacocoagent.jar=jmx=true 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=5001 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false 
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
```

There currently is no support for an authenticated jmx connection.

By default, the folder `/config` is part of the classpath, please mount/load the configuration into this folder.
The exporter is a standard spring boot application, which means you should also be able to let it fetch its configuration from a spring cloud config server.

```YAML
coverage: 
    prometheus:
        prefix: "int"               # prefix to be used for all prometheus metrics relating to jacoco
        labels:
            system: "some-system"   # adds a set of custom labels to all jacoco metrics
    collect:
        providers:                  # A list of all jmx application coverage providers
            - name: my-application
              host: my-application-host
              port: 5001            # jmx port of your application
              sourcesLocations:
                - "/path/to/my-application/classes"
```

## Usage

Before starting to measure test coverage for your integration tests it might be a good idea to call `POST /v1/reset` to remove all the coverage generated by the startup of the system.
This way you will only measure the coverage generated by your integration tests.

Now you can run your test and either observe the rising test coverage inside Grafana or wait for the tests to finish and fetch the final results from the `/v1/coverage` endpoint.
